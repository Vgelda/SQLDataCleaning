Nashville Housing Data Cleaning and Exploration
Project Overview
In January 2023, I undertook a data cleaning and exploration project using a Kaggle dataset on Nashville housing. 
My primary focus was to showcase my data cleaning skills using SQL. Here are the key highlights:

Data Cleaning:
Standardized Date Format:
Ensured consistent date formats across the dataset.
Populated Property Address Data:
Filled in missing property address information.
Address Breakdown:
Separated address into individual columns (address, city, state).
Sold as Vacant Field:
Transformed “sold as vacant” values (Y/N) for clarity.
Duplicate Removal:
Eliminated duplicate records.
Unused Column Deletion:
Removed unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Property Distribution Across Cities:
Visualized the distribution of properties across different cities.
Properties per Owner:
Analyzed the number of properties owned by each individual.
Sold Properties per Year:
Explored trends in sold properties over time.
Price Categories and Analysis:
Investigated price categories and their impact.
Price Range per City:
Examined price ranges across Nashville’s various neighborhoods.
Impact:
Cleaned and transformed over 1000 records.
Provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in data cleaning, SQL, and exploratory analysis. I look forward to leveraging these skills in my next data analyst role.
